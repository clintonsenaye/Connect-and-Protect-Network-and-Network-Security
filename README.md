<h2>Connect and Protect: Network and Network Security</h2>

During this course, I gained knowledge of networks, network architecture, and security practices used to protect networks from potential security breaches. I began by examining network architecture, understanding the design to identify vulnerable components requiring security measures. My knowledge extended to network operations and their influence on data communication, where network protocols regulate data transmission. I learned about malicious actors' threats, such as denial of service attacks, packet sniffing, and IP spoofing, and implemented security measures, including firewall rules. I also learned about security hardening to reduce a network's attack surface and implementing measures at different levels, such as hardware, software, and the network. Finally, I learned that securing networks is vital for a security analyst's role, requiring a comprehensive grasp of network infrastructure, operations, and security protocols to succeed.

In one activity, I applied my network knowledge to analyze a network incident. I analyzed the situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and created an incident report.

<h3>Project description</h3>

As a cybersecurity analyst in a multimedia company offering various services to small businesses, a recent DDoS attack disrupted network services for two hours. The attack flooded the network with ICMP packets, rendering internal network traffic inaccessible. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, halting non-critical services, and restoring critical ones. A subsequent investigation revealed that a malicious actor exploited an unconfigured firewall, executing a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.
To address the breach, the network security team instituted several measures:

1. Implementing a new firewall rule to limit incoming ICMP packets' rate.
2. Introducing source IP address verification on the firewall to detect spoofed IP addresses.
3. Employing network monitoring software to detect unusual traffic patterns.
4. Utilizing an IDS/IPS system to filter ICMP traffic based on suspicious traits.

As a cybersecurity analyst, you're tasked with crafting a plan for enhancing network security, guided by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). This framework assists you in dissecting the incident, and you'll incorporate the analysis into a comprehensive security strategy.
